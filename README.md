# SQL-Task4

Objective:
In this task, I worked on using SQL aggregate functions to summarize data.
I also used GROUP BY to group the data and HAVING to filter the grouped results.

What I did:

Used COUNT() and AVG() to get totals and averages

Used GROUP BY to group data based on member or author

Used HAVING to filter the grouped data with conditions

Queries I wrote:

Counted how many books each member has borrowed

Counted how many books each author has written

Found the average publication year of all books

Listed members who borrowed more than one book

Found the total number of borrowed books

Listed authors who have written at least two books

Result:
I learned how to use aggregate functions to get useful insights from data.
I also understood how GROUP BY and HAVING work together to analyze grouped information.
